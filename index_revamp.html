One day I returned to Stanford campus from a hiking trip, and I saw a lot of people walking around with their mobile phones. Probably a task for new students to get to know the campus, I thought. It took me two days to figure out that it wasn't.</div>

But here were new and interactive elements, and an impressive cultural impact. I installed the game and, after playing a bit, I decided that I want to understand better. I wanted to get more out of this.</div>
