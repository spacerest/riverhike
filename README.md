# riverhike

Full-on rebuild of this website to make it mobile responsive and less heavy-weight.

## Pieces

* Top post with GIF
* Text post
* Image + text post
* Only image post
* Table with catches and hatches
* Hero image section divider + titles

## TODO

On phone screens it only covers half the screen for some reason


## Notes

	<!-- TODO: add a JS file that allows to "catch" and "hatch" my notes. Basically, it would be a button
	or even cooler something with swiping, or moving the mouse (imitating a ball-throw), that collapses
	a note paragraph into a pokeball image.-->
	<!-- the pokeballs could stack in a neat row on top somehow -->
	<!-- when clicking on it again (or clicking on "hatch" somewhere), the ball would transform into an egg sprite
	and then maybe it would take a few seconds (or a bit of scrolling, haha!) for the comment to expand again. -->
	<!-- these are awesome fun ideas!! : D -->
	<!-- There could be a "Masterball" option, that collapses all notes at once! -->
